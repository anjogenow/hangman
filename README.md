# Hangman Game

Guess the word or you hang!!! The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player needs to guess the letters of the word within a limited number of attempts. The player loses a life for each incorrect guess, and the game ends when either the word is correctly guessed or the player runs out of lives.
